            of the Assistant Athletic Director - Club Sports & eSports, two Assistant Directors of Club Sports,
            and the coordinator of Club Sports in partnership with the Northeastern University Department
            of Athletics. Their role as the Club Sport teams official advisors is to enforce all university
            policies/procedures, provide administrative assistance, leadership training/opportunities,
            scheduling support, budgeting assistance and oversight, etc. to each individual club sport
            executive board and their members. Each club is developed, governed, and administered by the
            student leadership of that club.
