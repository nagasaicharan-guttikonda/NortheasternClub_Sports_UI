        <h3>Policies</h3>
        
        <p>
          The Club Sports Office reserves the right to suspend or uphold budgetary transactions if team does not stay compliant to University and Club Sport policies, procedures or guidelines
        </p>    
        <h3>Establish club sport</h3>
        <p>
          In order to propose a new Club Sports at Northeastern University, four main criteria must be met:

Local Competition– Local defined as Universities/Colleges within New England with Club Sports Departments comparable in scope to Northeastern University
Student Interest- At least 1 and a half of a competitive lineup must be on roster (i.e. Basketball= 8)
Financial Feasibility– Club must be able to maintain a proper amount of funding throughout the year so that costs of operation do not exceed a feasible amount of income to the team
National Governing Body– Organization that oversees rules and regulations and has a national championship event
In addition to meeting all four of the above, a new Club Sport must also submit a Team Constitution describing club policies and procedures. This is the document that will provide direction and structure to your club. The Club Sports Office has sample constitutions if one is required.

The Club Sports Office has the right to deny any proposal based on department budget, safety concern, and staffing restraints.

Northeastern University Club Sport Teams must be a member in good standing with a Regional Conference or National Sport Governing Body with developed standards of competition, participation compliance and an established/organized championship structure.

To be considered for Northeastern University Club Sport status teams need to present through proposal these tenants of consideration; Local Competition, Student Interest, Financial Feasibility, and a National Sport Governing Body as reviewed, considered and approved by the Club Sports Office
